### 🎨 Design Fidelity

The implementation follows your Figma design precisely:
- ✅ Exact color palette (blue-01 through blue-06)
- ✅ Typography (Satoshi font family, correct weights and sizes)
- ✅ Spacing and layout (100px padding, proper gaps)
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints (1440px and 768px)
- ✅ Gradient text effect
- ✅ Hover states and transitions

### 📱 Responsive Design

Fully responsive with three breakpoints:
- **Desktop** (1920px): Full multi-column layout
- **Tablet** (1440px): Stacked layout, adjusted spacing
- **Mobile** (768px): Single column, reduced font sizes

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### 1. Replace Placeholder Images

Replace these placeholder files with actual images from your Figma design:

```
public/assets/about-hero.webp          # Main hero image (wastewater plant)
public/assets/icon-pencil-ruler.svg    # Customized Solutions icon
public/assets/icon-mail.svg            # Free Consultation icon  
public/assets/icon-handshake.svg       # End-to-End Support icon
public/assets/flag-brazil.svg          # Brazil flag icon
```

The factory images already exist:
- ✅ `public/assets/factory-2.webp`
- ✅ `public/assets/factory-3.webp`
- ✅ `public/assets/factory-4.webp`

### 2. Add Contact Form

In the Contact Section (bottom right), there's a placeholder for a form. You can:
- Add Tally form embed
- Create a custom contact form
- Or link to your contact page

Location: Lines 159-163 in `src/pages/about.astro`

### 3. Export Images from Figma

To export the required images from Figma:

1. **Hero Image** (`about-hero.webp`):
   - Select the Rectangle 147 image layer
   - Export as WebP format
   - Recommended size: 1920x600px

2. **Icons** (export as SVG):
   - lucide/pencil-ruler → `icon-pencil-ruler.svg`
   - lucide/mail → `icon-mail.svg`
   - lucide/handshake → `icon-handshake.svg`
   - Brazil (BR) flag → `flag-brazil.svg`

### 4. Optional: Customize Content

You can update the text content by editing translations in:
```
src/i18n/translations.ts
```

Look for the `about` section in each language.
