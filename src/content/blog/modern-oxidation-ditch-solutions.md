The oxidation ditch process stands at the forefront of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment worldwide, valued for its efficiency, operational simplicity, and ability to meet stringent discharge standards. With ongoing technological innovation, new solutions such as the Biojet® oxidation ditch are redefining what’s possible in aeration performance and cost-effectiveness.

### What is an Oxidation Ditch?

An oxidation ditch is a type of extended aeration activated sludge process featuring a closed-loop channel (often oval or ring-shaped) where wastewater is circulated, aerated, and biologically treated. The system maintains optimal conditions for aerobic microorganisms, enabling thorough degradation of organic pollutants and nutrients. Aeration and circulation are traditionally handled by surface-mounted devices like rotors and brushes, but technological advances now allow for submerged aeration equipment and jet aeration integration.

### Key Benefits and Applications

- **High Treatment Efficiency**: Oxidation ditches can effectively remove biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrogen, and phosphorus due to their long solids retention times (SRTs) and flexible zone controls.​

- **Stable Operation and Low Maintenance**: Extended-holding times make these systems resilient against fluctuations in influent load and quality, requiring minimal oversight and chemical addition.​

- **Adaptable Flow and Footprint**: The closed-loop design enables “plug-flow” characteristics—with zones alternating between oxic and anoxic—facilitating efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Facility footprint is often reduced compared to conventional tank systems.​

- **Reduced Sludge Production**: The extended aeration process results in lower excess sludge generation versus other secondary biological processes.

### Jet Aeration: The Next-Gen Upgrade

Jet aeration combines aeration and mixing by injecting air and liquid through submerged jets, maximizing oxygen transfer even in deeper basins. This technology offers:​

- Improved Oxygen Transfer Rate: Submerged jet aerators leverages increased water depth and extended bubble contact time to enhance oxygen uptake, outperforming typical surface aerators—especially in oxidation ditch applications.​

- Efficient Mixing and Flow: Independent control of mixing and aeration strengthens process flexibility and minimizes energy use, with robust construction ensuring long service life.​

- Compact Design: Jet aerators allow operation with deeper ditches (up to 24 feet), reducing facility footprint and construction costs.

### Biojet® Oxidation Ditch Solution

Biojet® leverages cutting-edge jet aeration for an integrated approach to both aeration and circulation. Biojet® oxidation ditch system adopts cutting-edge jet aeration technology that integrates both aeration and push-flow functions. Its optimized design achieves several key benefits:

- **Exceptional Water Depth and Oxygen Transfer**: By operating at greater water depths, Biojet’s ditch ensures a higher oxygen transfer rate, promoting efficient biological treatment.

- **Enhanced Mixing and Circulation**: Tailored jet aerators maintain ideal dissolved oxygen levels while circulating the mixed liquor, eliminating dead zones and supporting complete nutrient removal.

- **Energy and Cost Savings**: With reduced energy requirements and simplified maintenance, Biojet’s system delivers a cost-effective way to meet stringent discharge standards.
