Oxidation ditch and Aerators

## DESCRIPTION
An oxidation ditch is a modified activated sludge
biological treatment process that utilizes long solids
retention times (SRTs) to remove biodegradable
organics. Oxidation ditches are typically complete
mix systems, but they can be modified to approach
plug flow conditions. (Note: as conditions approach
plug flow, diffused air must be used to provide
enough mixing. The system will also no longer
operate as an oxidation ditch). Typical oxidation
ditch treatment systems consist of a single or multichannel configuration within a ring, oval, or
horseshoe-shaped basin. As a result, oxidation
ditches are called “racetrack type” reactors.
Horizontally or vertically mounted aerators provide
circulation, oxygen transfer, and aeration in the
ditch.
Preliminary treatment, such as bar screens and grit
removal, normally precedes the oxidation ditch.
Primary settling prior to an oxidation ditch is
sometimes practiced, but is not typical in this
design. Tertiary filters may be required after
clarification, depending on the effluent
requirements. Disinfection is required and
reaeration may be necessary prior to final discharge.
Flow to the oxidation ditch is aerated and mixed
with return sludge from a secondary clarifier. A
typical process flow diagram for an activated sludge
plant using an oxidation ditch is shown in Figure 1output treatment applications. It also reduces the size, and often the number, of pump stations required.

%% APPLICABILITY
The oxidation ditch process is a fully demonstrated
secondary wastewater treatment technology,
applicable in any situation where activated sludge
treatment (conventional or extended aeration) is
appropriate. Oxidation ditches are applicable in
plants that require nitrification because the basins
can be sized using an appropriate SRT to achieve
nitrification at the mixed liquor minimum
temperature. This technology is very effective in
small installations, small communities, and isolated
institutions, because it requires more land than
conventional treatment plants.

### Advantages
The main advantage of the oxidation ditch is the
ability to achieve removal performance objectives
with low operational requirements and operation
and maintenance costs. Some specific advantages
of oxidation ditches include:
* An added measure of reliability and
performance over other biological processes
owing to a constant water level and
continuous discharge which lowers the weir
overflow rate and eliminates the periodic
effluent surge common to other biological
processes, such as SBRs.
* Long hydraulic retention time and complete
mixing minimize the impact of a shock load
or hydraulic surge.
* Produces less sludge than other biological
treatment processes owing to extended
biological activity during the activated sludge
process.
* Energy efficient operations result in reduced
energy costs compared with other biological
treatment processes.

## Disadvantages
* Effluent suspended solids concentrations are
relatively high compared to other
modifications of the activated sludge process.
* Requires a larger land area than other
activated sludge treatment options. This can
prove costly, limiting the feasibility of
oxidationditches in urban, suburban, or other
areas where land acquisition costs are
relatively high.

## DESIGN CRITERIA
Construction
Oxidation ditches are commonly constructed using
reinforced concrete, although gunite, asphalt, butyl
rubber, and clay have also been used. Impervious
materials, are usually used to prevent erosion.
